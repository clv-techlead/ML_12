# SRC README

This folder was created for modular scripts, but ultimately was not used as all analysis work was done in Jupyter Notebooks

**Data consolidation:** data/model.ipynb
**Feature Enginering:** data/EDA and Feature Engineering-TTC Streetcar Delay Project.ipynb
**Model training and evaluation:** models/ttc_modeling.ipynb

**Future Enhancement:** 
For production deployment, notebook code should be refactored into modular Python scripts in this directory for: <br>
- Easier testing and version control <br>
- Command-line execution <br>
- Integration into automated pipelines
