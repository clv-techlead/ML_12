ML12 Project
## Business case
This project aims to help the TTC improve service reliability and operational response by identifying and predicting the types of streetcar incidents that cause delays. By building a classification model that learns from historical data (2014–2025), the organization can better understand which factors—such as route, time of day, delay duration, or location, are most associated with different incident types. These insights can be used to optimize scheduling, allocate maintenance crews more effectively, and enhance coordination between transit control, operators, and emergency response teams.

From a business perspective, this analysis delivers data-driven decision support to reduce downtime, improve passenger satisfaction, and enhance resource efficiency. With accurate incident classification and trend analysis, TTC planners can prioritize investments (for example signal upgrades or track maintenance) where recurrent delays occur, and potentially anticipate high-risk periods or routes. Over time, this leads to lower operational costs, improved on-time performance metrics, and more transparent public reporting of service reliability, key factors in maintaining trust and ridership in Toronto’s transit system.
